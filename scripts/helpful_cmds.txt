# SecurityQTPi 
to run the autostart_systemd.sh script cd into the directory where the script is and type:
    ./autostart_systemd.sh
    
autostart_systemd.sh is a one time script that sets up the config to systemctl.

once ^ this is done then you will want to start the service:
sudo systemctl start securityqtpi@pi.service

Other systemctl cmds:
sudo systemctl status securityqtpi@pi.service #Outputs logs
sudo systemctl stop securityqtpi@pi.service #Stops the app from running can resume with start 
sudo systemctl --system daemon-reload

# MQTT
sudo mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf -v -d # start the MQTT broker in deamon 

systemctl status mosquitto #Outputs logs

mosquitto_sub -d -u USERNAME -P PASSWORD -t "homeassistant/cover/Zone1/state" # Good for watching subscription and testing MQTT user/pass works

sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile USERNAME # Change MQTT Broker password, you will need to restart the MQTT Service to pickup the username/password change.

mosquitto_pub -d -u username -P password -t "homeassistant/cover/Zone1/state" -m "open" # You can publish an open message that will make Home-Assistant think something has opened. This helps with setting up automations in HA so you don't have to constantly open/close doors and windows on setup.
