mosquitto_sub -d -u USERNAME -P PASSWORD -t "homeassistant/cover/Zone1/state" # Good for watching subscription and testing MQTT user/pass works

sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile USERNAME # Change MQTT Broker password, you will need to restart the MQTT Service to pickup the username/password change.

mosquitto_pub -d -u username -P password -t "homeassistant/cover/Zone1/state" -m "open" # You can publish an open message that will make Home-Assistant think something has opened. This helps with setting up automations in HA so you don't have to constantly open/close doors and windows on setup.
